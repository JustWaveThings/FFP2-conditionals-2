>    In this task you are provided with two variables:
> 
>   season — contains a string that says what the current season is.
> 
  > reponse — begins uninitialized, but is later used to store a response that will be printed to the output panel.
> 
  > We want you to create a conditional that checks whether season contains the string "summer", and if so assigns a string to response that gives the user an appropriate message about the season. If not, it should assign a generic string to response that tells the user we don't know what season it is.
> 
  > To finish off, you should then add another test that checks whether season contains the string "winter", and again assigns an appropriate string to response."
